The problem turned out to be a combination of improperly configured Firebase security rules and a potential issue with data structure if it was a nested object.  First, I checked my security rules to ensure that the write operation was permitted. The rules should allow writes for the authenticated user to the specific path. 
If security rules were properly set, the issue might have been caused by using reserved keywords or unexpected values in the object keys. This can cause issues while persisting data.
Here's a corrected version that should resolve the issue: 
```javascript
firebase.database().ref('/myData').set({ key1: 'value1' }).then(() => { console.log('Data written!'); }).catch(error => { console.error('Error writing data:', error); });
```
The addition of the `.catch()` block is crucial for debugging. It will provide meaningful error messages if the `set()` operation fails for any reason.
